I spent wonderful years at [VinBrain](https://vinbrain.net/) as an Applied Scientist, researching and developing AI models for detecting medical abnormalities. Before that, I was an AI research intern at [Vingroup BigData Institute](https://institute.vinbigdata.org/en/about/) and a Data Scientist at [Viettel](https://viettel.com.vn/en/news-events/news/viettel-to-build-the-largest-data-center-in-vietnam/) where I focused on exploratory data analysis and build large-scale machine learning model in telecom domains.

My research interest lies in the intersection of Anomaly Detection, Computer Vision, AI models continuously adaptable to changing data environments, and their applications to real-world domains such as healthcare and economics. I am a massive badminton fan and won a silver medal in a competition.
